										<!-- As cheesy as it may sound, the first detection -->
										It was the first direct detection of
										of gravitational waves in 2015, which was discussed
										heavily in the media (especially in my hometown Hannover,
										<!-- due to the Max-Planck-Institute for Gravitational Physics -->
										due to the Albert-Einstein-Institute
										being located there), that first sparked my
										interest in Physics and ultimately motivated me to study
										this subject. My institution of choice
										as a Hannover native was Leibniz University Hannover, where
										I obtained both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Physics.
										Over the course of my studies, I leaned more and more towards
										the computational side of physics, enjoying programming and
										data analysis/statistics a lot.
										<br />
										<br />

										As part of these degrees, I spent a total of about two wonderful years
										working on my Bachelor's and Master's theses in Frank Ohme's group
										at the Albert-Einstein-Institute in Hannover
										(for me personally, that was a really nice full-circle moment).
										Finding this group was truly a blessing, as I got to meet incredibly
										nice people <em>and</em> work on the intersection of gravitational-wave physics
										and data analysis.<!--, which remains my main research interest to this day. -->
										<br />
										<br />

										While still working on my Master's thesis, I received the great news
										that I had been accepted for a PhD position at Caltech,
										which I started in fall 2025. This is the perfect place for me to
										continue pursuing my interest in (gravitational-wave) physics
										and I am still incredibly grateful for this opportunity.

										<h2>Personal</h2>
										<p>What I do apart from science</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										In my free time, I like to spend time working out,
										running, or playing football (the one also known as soccer).
										I also love to watch all kinds of sports and
										definitely spend too much time on Fantasy Football.
										<br />
										Besides that I enjoy photography, my favorite subject
										being landscapes (currently,
										I am the proud owner of a Fujifilm X-T30).
										<br />
										<br />
										Moreover, I love to create plots that visualize my
										research or simply look cool. If you are interested,
										just checkout my GitHub, for example the
										<a href="https://github.com/MaxMelching/gwbar">gwbar</a>,
										<a href="https://github.com/MaxMelching/gwtheme">gwtheme</a>,
